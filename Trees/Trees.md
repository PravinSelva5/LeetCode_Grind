## What is a tree?

A (1) connected (2) acyclic (3) undirected graph.

Different types of trees:

- m-ary trees: every internal vertex of the tree has no more than m children (example: binary tree)
- Remeber that a leaf node is one that has no children.
- Tree Height: the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf

## Balanced Binary Trees

- No side in the tree is greater than one another. They're all the same height.
- The difference in height should not be greater than 1. If it is, it is not considered a **balanced binary tree**
- **A binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1**
- **An unbalanded binary tree** is one in which the depth of the two subtrees of a node **differ by more than 1**.
